<p>I wanted to cook some Turkish food tonight.  I love Turkish food, meat, bread, salad, meat.  What's not to like?</p>
<p> Turkish food, when done well, is fantastic, but I had a motive above food.  It's all due to this stupid blog of mine.</p>
<p> When Isis was young (she's still young, but I mean very young - 2/3) we used to watch videos on You Tube together.  She had
some favourites, such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLUV74hxa34" target="_blank">Five little ducks,</a>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vPzg7VLUsY" target="_blank"> Skidamarink</a> 
and this from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VosFiY1SifA" target="_blank">Jon Anderson</a> which is probably
my doing.  But the one she loved best of all, is the lullaby I've embedded here.</p>
<p> We'd watch this over and over again.  I love it too.  I've no idea what they are singing but who cares.  Cows eating
cabbages and babies in the moon.  Perfect for a two year old.</p>
<p> So just as an excuse to put this lovely video on my blog, I cooked some Turkish food, but tonight I had a very tough
crowd.</p>
<p> Toni was in a somewhat downish mood.  The kids were hyper and the combination wasn't helping.</p>
<p> As I said, this was a tough crowd.</p>
<p> First, Isis started to complain that the chicken tasted of tomatoes.  Then Toni said the potatoes were undercooked,
then Eve said she didn't like any of it except the bread.  The chicken did taste of tomatoes, it was covered in it.  The
potatoes were a little undercooked, but it's not easy doing this when you partner is upstairs with a headache and you have three
kids under six to entertain while cooking.  And yes, Eve was correct, the bread was very tasty.</p>
<p> I liked this dinner.  It wasn't perfect, but the chicken, salad and bread really hit the spot.  After her complaining, Isis ate two
chicken wings and Toni managed to polish off quite a bit too.  But it was a tough crowd, the reviews in tomorrow's Daily Borresen won't
be good.</p>
<p> Chips tomorrow. That'll cheer them up - I've something special too. I might fall on my arse though, which is entirely possible.</p>

in a crock pot. Make a paste from the tomato pur&eacutee, cumin, some olive oil, sumak, cinnamon and pepper.  Rub the paste over
the chicken and lay this over the vegetables, sprinkle any left over paste on top.  Put the lid on and bake for &frac12 hour 
then remove the lid and bake for a further &frac12 hour.  If the potatoes are still undercooked after an hour of cooking bung
them in the microwave or the bin.
