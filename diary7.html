<p> Today I was absolutely knackered.  My life isn't the easiest normally, but as I had twisted my neck on the slab of Dr
Frankenstein yesterday, I hardly slept and the sleep I did get was always with a nagging pain that stopped me really
relaxing.  When I woke up I felt awful.  I also had to go to work early with no breakfast.  About 12.00 I was
so out of it I was convinced my name was Gerald and I was living as a hermit in the Outer Hebrides.  I had
to skive off unwell and come home.</p>
<p> Fortunately, when I got home it was Olias's nap time.  I took him upstairs, laid on the bed and put him on my
chest, where we fell asleep for an hour or so.  You may think of it as lovely bonding, to me it was a good rest.</p>
<p> After a snooze, I was feeling much more chipper - my neck still hurts though, maybe I'll sue for compensation.</p>

<br><div style="text-align: center;">***************************************</div><br>
<p> Today I looked in the fridge and there was some left over pork from a few days ago.  I'd cooked it for my pulled pork
sandwiches and now it needed to be used.  What to do?  What to do?</p>
<p> Well, the pork, although coated in a little American style rub is really just slow roast pork - so
I decided to use it in a sort of Thai style pork stew.  I almost never throw anything away, any left overs
are kept and eaten for lunch, or cooked up as something else.  I'm far too mean to throw good food away.</p>
<p> Today's dinner was really quite tasty.  It doesn't look great (a big blob of stringy meat), but it went down
well with Toni and me.  The kids looked at it said yuk and ran off though.  I'll make something a bit more kid
friendly tomorrow.  Fish Fingers?  Horse Burgers?  Suggestions always welcome.

shallots and fry in oil then add the curry paste.  Fry a little longer then add the coconut milk, sugar,
chillies and fish sauce.  Simmer gently until the sauce has reduced by &frac12 then add the pork.  Cook for a further
