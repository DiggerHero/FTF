I have things I need to do but no matter how hard I try to do them, I am having no luck.  I've beentrying to write this blog for ages, but every time I make a start, somebody does their level best to stop me.</p><p> I also have some work things I need to do, but coming to work doesn't seem to help.  As soon as I start anything, somebodyis knocking on the door asking me to do something menial or irrelevant.  There is no peace.  I am going mad withthe constant noise of life.  I tried putting a sign on the door once saying "Please do not disturb - I am very busy." but some people completely ignored this and just waltzed on in anyway.  Yesterday, I was eating my lunch in my office,the door was shut and I had heaphones on.  To anyone outside who would be able to see me through the glass it should be perfectly obvious that I wasn't hoping for somebody to come waltzing in and start talking to me aboutsomething which was in no way urgent, pressing or even important.  GO AWAY!</p><p> In two days time it will all change for a bit.  The Easter holidays begin and for a short while at least I won'thave armies of students knocking at my door asking for an extra mark on their assignment or other colleaguesasking me to check this, do that and whatever else.</p><p> If you can't tell, I am really cheesed off.  All I want is for the next time somebody is in my general vicinity thatthey just leave me alone.  I don't mind them being here, but I don't want them attracting my attention.  Let my mindhave some stillness - just for a little while.</p><p> Try the video with heaphones on - that's more like it.</p>
