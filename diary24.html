I've eaten chicken's feet on at least two occasions but I don't think I'll be making any effort to do this again. </p>  <br><br><p> Odd dinner today - not the food, the food was really quite good.  After Isis and Eve poo-pooing yesterday's concoction I thought I'd cook something they would both love.  The whole family loves roast dinners and the generally accepted favourite is roast pork.  In addition I made stuffing balls with some really excellent 95% meat Cumberland sausage, some more Cumberland chipolatas wrapped in dry cure streaky bacon and some excellent potatoes roasted in duck fat.  The gravy was very tasty and there were salt & pepper sugar snap peas and mushrooms, cooked just crunchy but not raw.  What more could one ask for on a lazy Sunday when it's freezing cold and there's a howling gale and flurries of snow?</p> <p> Oddly however neither Eve nor Isis seemed at all interested.  I think they may have eaten a little stuffing and maybe a potato and gravy but nothing else.  I don't think Isis even tried the pork and she normally loves sausages in bacon.  Odd. Very odd.  I hope they aren't coming down with something.</p>       <br><div style="text-align: center;">***************************************</div><br> <br><br><br> <img src="Extra24_1.JPG" title="Plum Crumble" alt="" align="right" style="width: 250px; height: 167px;"> <a name="recipes"></a> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#00FF00">Menu</font></b> <li> Roast Pork Loin (with crackling) <li> Roast Potatoes <li> Sausages wrapped in bacon <li> Cumberland Sausage Stuffing Balls <li> Sugar Snap Peas and Mushrooms with Salt and Pepper <li> Gravy <br><br> <li> Plum Crumble and Custard  <br><br>Today’s Ratings:<br><br> Isis:  OK - not overly interested today.<br> Eve: OK - not overly interested today either.<br> Olias:  Yum.    <!-- begin htmlcommentbox.com -->  <div id="HCB_comment_box"><a href="http://www.htmlcommentbox.com">HTML Comment Box</a> is loading comments...</div>  <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" id="hcb"> /*<!--*/ if(!window.hcb_user){hcb_user={};} (function(){s=document.createElement("script");s.setAttribute("type","text/javascript");s.setAttribute("src", "http://www.htmlcommentbox.com/jread?page="+escape((window.hcb_user && hcb_user.PAGE)||(""+window.location)).replace("+","%2B")+"&mod=%241%24wq1rdBcg%241h28D3wueeWxVX59IHAiu."+"&opts=0&num=10");if (typeof s!="undefined") document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s);})(); /*-->*/ </script> <!-- end htmlcommentbox.com -->  <br> </font></font> <a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-via="JonBorresen">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");</script> <br><br> JCBorresen@GMail.com <br><br><br><br><br><br> </div> </body> </html>
