<p> A spiffing day today.  The kinder were off with nanny and the woman was away at some gymkhana thingy with the riding club.  Time to get out
the old 16 bore and have at a few birds.</p>
<p> Luckily for me, our little pad in Oxfordshire is smack in the migratory path of some very rare Northern Shovellers and anything Northern in my book is fare game.  So it was - "Have at themand don't spare the shot."</p><p> What a glorious day.  Popping away at anything that moved, a snifter of Semp&eacute; armangacto keep of the cold and a piping hot shooters sandwich of rump steak and mushrooms in a hollowed out loaf.</p><p> I have to confess to not being the best of shots. At one point I winged a small blighter, whichspiralled Earthwards.  My second shot at him sadly fell wild of the mark and I managed to pop out one eyeof our pointer "Gerald the Duke", a lovely black lab that has been with us for 5 years now.  Well,there's no point having a one eyed gun dog so "Crack." no more old Duke.  Shame really, we were going to stud himwith a bitch at the Caruthers's.  Oh well.</p><p> So there was plenty of duck for today's dinner.  My man Borrie is an excellent cook and rustled upsomething quite special.  Hurrah for the countryside, hurrah I say.

<li> Poached Carrots
<li> Cranberry Sauce
<li> Gravy
<br><br>
Notes: I dind't do a lot to the duck, just roasted it, drained off the liquid and used the fat to roast the potatoes and
the stock to make gravy.  The carrots were poached in chicken stock and a bit more of this stock was used for the gravy
too (and some white wine).  The only interesting thing (apart from everything being tasty, tasty, tasty) was
the braised cabbage - better than stewing it until your house smells like my old Nan's sheltered accomodation block.
