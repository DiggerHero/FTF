<p> Mother's Day today - or if you are a wanky old bastard (ie the BBC) Mothering Sunday.  I don't give a hoot about the history
of the day or what it is really about, if I don't get my Mum a card and make sure the kids do something
for Toni, I will have failed in my son/dad duties.</p>
<p> Luckily I got a good night's sleep and was feeling chipper.  The kids were up at about 6.00 and managed to drag Toni out
of bed before me - ha! No breakfast in bed for you today.</p>
<p> Sunday morning Isis goes to gym and I usually take Eve and Olias to buy a milky bar and a paper - but it is bloody freezing.  Winter
has come back and it's worse than ever.  Eve, being somewhat averse to going out in the cold, managed to convince me to stay
in and play tents instead.</p>
<p> After lunch (a really tasty king prawn fried rice dish, rustled up in a hurry using some left over cajun rice) we all
went to the Pottery Corner in Chorlton to make a hand print plate and to blow a month's fun budget in ten minutes.  After
this, I played with the kids for a bit.  Then it was time to cook dinner.   Olias was a bit gripey and I had to carry
him while I did most of this, also Isis and Eve were making a small tent in the 
kitchen out of assorted furniture, providing a dangerous obstacle, while I carried around boiling hot fat and bubbling pans
- and the baby.</p>
<p> Possibly not recommended by social services, but I get the job done.</p>
<p> After dinner I took Olias upstairs for a bath and the two other children followed.  Joy, unalloyed joy.</p>
<p> Mother's day:  It's traditional for men to help out a bit with the kids, maybe cook dinner and give the ladies
a rest from their hard labours.</p>
<p> Draw your own conclusions.</p>
<br><br>
<p> Today's video.  Somebody sent Toni this on Facebook.  It's not the original by Anita Renfroe, but this lady has a better
voice for this sort of thing.

<p> There have been some problems with my Dad lately as well.  I had to call an ambulance to take him to hospital
yesterday.  He lives in Swansea, some 200 miles from me.  Apparently he collapsed in an opticians and they sent him home 
in a cab.  When I found out, I called to see if he was ok and he collapsed again.  He was taken into hospital overnight.  When they
took him home the next day, the ambulance drove off, leaving him outside his house, but his door was jammed.  He phoned me to let me know
he was standing in the freezing cold and was really scared.  I phoned the police who went to help, then needed to get
a locksmith to get him back into his house.</p><p> When it rains...</p>

Note: We bought a little pack of venison in Morrisons for about £3.00 - but upon opening realised there wasn't enough
inside to do much apart from make a little pie.  Sadly my pastry making is really bad, possibly due to me having very hot hands
(good for bread making though)  As such my plan was to make a raised pie with hot water crust pastry but
I didn't have any lard.  I improvised a bit and used a mixtue of butter and olive oil instead.  This worked fine but
the pastry was a little less crumbly than normal.  This pastry is really easy to make and doesn't even need a rolling pin
or make any mess rolling it out.
 

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#FF6103">Preparation</font></b><br><br>
<li> Pie Filling: Brown the venison in a pan then add the wine.  Simmer for a minute or two then sprinkle over 1 TBSP of flour.  Stir
well then add the chicken stock, some salt and pepper.  
Cook very gently for an hour - until the meat is really tender.  If it starts to thikcne too much add a little more water or stock.
<li> Hot Water Crust Pastry: Sift the flour into a bowl and add some salt.  Put the butter into a jug and pour over boiling water.  Add 
some olive oil and put into a microwave until it begins to bubble.  Pour the liquid over the flour and mix really well.  Knead
to make a dough.  
<li> Pie: Mould most of the dough into a dish (saving a little for the top).  Put the venison in and put a
lid on the pie.  Bake for 1 hour at about 150c.
