</p>Bugger me.</p>
<p> For dinner today I cooked something that I thought was an old retro classic - something we all grew up with and
knew and loved.  I was under the impression that it was a dish that had been served for generations in homes all
around Britain and was a staple of our Anglo-Saxon forefathers.  Cod in parsley sauce.</p>
<p> Of course it was - we've been eating this for generations haven't we?  My Grandma used to make this on
Fridays when meat was still banned.  Her Gran made it for waifs and strays in the workhouse and 
before her, hordes of Angles and Saxons fought over the recipe on the fields of Essex in the year 511 initiating the
first and only true cod war*.</p>
<p> We've been eating this since the beginning of the British Empire - since the days of the Armada, The Boer wars and 
the Robot invasion of 2354.</p>
<p> But I think my memory may have been manipulated by some clever advertising chaps.</p>
<p> I have been programmed.</p>
<p> I Googled cod in parsley sauce and couldn't find anything authentic.  There were no old recipes for this 'classic dish' -
there are no end of new sites, all sponsored by somebody asking you to buy something (see the video of the guy who 
waves a knife around as though he is going to gut his audience and can't
finish words, saying "approx" and "max" as though he is reading a recipe without actually processing it into
English with his brain).</p>
<p> Give me a minute while I check Mrs Beeton........</p>
<p> If any British dish existed before 1859 then Mrs Beeton would have it - and it doesn't.  There's no cod in parsley
sauce, there is no parsley sauce at all.  It never existed before 1859.  I doubt it existed before 1975.</p>
<p> Oh - I have another book to check, this one from the 70's and it's a beast.</p>
<p> British Cookery, Edited by Lizzie Boyd (1976) is perhaps the most ponderous tome ever written on the food of the British
people from this era.  It's not a cookery book as such, more a dictionary of everything that was occurring in our islands at the time - 
and there is no cod in parsley sauce.  There's a parsley and butter sauce, but no mention of cod.  (I think this sauce was traditionally
served in &Eacuteire with corned beef, not fish).</p>
<p> And this really gives the game away:  The British Film Industry have a page detailing an advert for 
<a href="http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b7af8eef5" target="_blank">Findus Cod in Parsley Sauce.</a>  There are no
details, no cast, crew, credits.  It's cold and bare but it does tell us that whatever we are watching is new, completely new.  The
BFI don't do retro, they don't do remakes.  They are the most elite, academic and specific film organisation in the world - if they
mention you, you have done something new - and this was something new; a food product invented by a company, which the advertisersmade us think was something we had always been eating.</p>
<p> Cod in Parsley sauce.</p>
<p> I always thought it was a classic dish.  Somebody made me think that.</p>
<p> My mind has been manipulated.</p>
<p> It was an invention of the embryonic 1970s industrial food complex and the idea that it always existed has been implanted in my brain.</p>
<p> I started off to write a blog, slagging of the people who gave us little squares of fish in sauce which you
boiled or microwaved in the bag, but ended up scaring myself about how easily I can be told what to think.</p>
<p> It has made me feel quite numb.</p>
<p> Dinner was tasty thought - well done Findus.</p>



<p> <small> *Not like that phoney one in the 70's where Iceland tried to fish in its own 
territorial waters, before the British Navy shot at them, leading to Iceland threatening to ban NATO troops from its
soil and Britain quickly giving in.</small> </p>

<li> This isn't the Findus boil in the bag version or the one in the video:<br>
First make a little poaching liquor by boiling some bay leaves, celery, spring onion and carrot in water (about 200ml should be enough).  Bubble away for 15 minutes then
 add a little white wine and turn the heat down - simmer for another 2 minutes.  Put the fish in and cook gently for 3 minutes then turn off 
 the heat, put a lid on the pan and leave the fish in the water to cook through. Meanwhile make the sauce.
<li> Sauce: Melt some butter in a pan, add a little flour, stir and cook to make a roux, then stir in the milk.  Add the liquid from the 
fish and some pepper and
salt.  Stir while it cooks to make sure it doesn't stick.  Pour in some cream and chopped parsley the put the fish in the sauce.
